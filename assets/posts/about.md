I'm a web developer, designer, and journalist interested in building tools to help people make sense of complex data and information.

In my spare time I climb rocks, ride bikes, bake breads, play the guitar, and hang with my cat, [Julius](assets/images/julius.jpg).

You can find [my resume here](assets/data/charlie_smart_resume_201812.pdf) and I can be reached via email at:
