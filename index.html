        Hello,
      </p>
      <p class="big">
        My name is Charlie Smart. I’m a journalist, designer, and software developer interested in building digital tools to find and tell stories hidden in complex data. <a target="_blank" class="social" href="https://twitter.com/charliersmart">[twitter]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment, I work as a developer and designer at <a class="wiggle" target="_blank" href="https://pudding.cool">The Pudding</a>. In the past, I’ve worked with Fathom Information Design, FiveThirtyEight, and TrendCT. Here are some projects I’m proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used WebGL and custom-designed maps to <a class="image-link" data-image="nj_flood.mp4" target="_blank" href="https://njcoastalrisk.com/">visualize the properties</a> threatened by sea level rise in New Jersey for the Climate Impact Lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        I trained a text classifier to sort every tweet by members of Congress into policy topics and <a class="image-link" data-image="congress_tweets.mp4" target="_blank" href="https://congress.pudding.cool">built a web app</a> to explore that data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I analyzed <a class="image-link" data-image="chyrons.mp4" target="_blank" href="https://pudding.cool/2018/01/chyrons/">18 million cable news chyrons</a> and wrote a story for The Pudding to show how the news you get depends on which channel you watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked with Fathom and ProPublica to <a class="image-link" data-image="propublica.mp4" target="_blank" href="https://projects.propublica.org/paying-the-president/">visualize the money spent at Trump properties</a> by campaigns and the federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
        I traveled through southern Louisiana to report on the <a class="image-link" data-image="louisiana.mp4" target="_blank" href="http://louisianaunderwater.uconn.edu/barrier-islands.html">effects of coastal degredation on local communities</a> and the ongoing efforts to slow the rate of land loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made lots of <a class="image-link" target="_blank" data-image="538_charts.mp4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-gop-bill-could-change-health-care-in-8-charts/">charts</a>, <a class="image-link" target="_blank" data-image="538_interactive.mp4" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/tipping-workers-minimum-wage/">interactives</a>, and <a class="image-link" data-image="538_story.mp4" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/obama-granted-clemency-unlike-any-other-president-in-history/">news stories</a> while working as a visual journalism intern at FiveThirtyEight.
      </p>
      <p>
        I helped build a tool to <a class="image-link" data-image="on_being.mp4" target="_blank" href="http://discover.onbeing.org">explore the archive of the podcast On Being</a> by tracing threads of related conversation across episodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built a website to <a class="image-link" target="_blank" data-image="fakebook.mp4" href="https://fathom.info/fakebook">explore the language used in the Facebook ads</a> payed for by the Russian government during the months leading up to the 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote, reported, and produced several podcasts, including one on the <a class="image-link" target="_blank" data-image="storrs.mp4" href="https://whus.org/category/podcasts/story-of-storrs/">history of UConn</a> and another on the <a class="image-link" target="_blank" data-image="ebd.mp4" href="https://fathom.info/ebd/">unexpected places data shows up</a> in our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I analyzed the <a class="image-link" data-image="yelp.mp4" target="_blank" href="https://fathom.info/yelp">language of Yelp reviews</a> to show how the words we use to describe food reflect the things we value.
      </p>
