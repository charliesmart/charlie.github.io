        Iâ€™m a cross-discipline journalist,
developer and information designer. I enjoy tackling tough problems involving lots of numbers and making them easy to
understand through good storytelling, software and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked on a tool to <a href="http://localhost:4000/visualization/2016/09/19/ONA-connect.html">connect
        people</a> at a journalism conference, a dashboard
        to examine how America <a href="http://localhost:4000/visualization/2016/10/10/measure.html">stacks up</a> against other
        countries and stories about <a href="http://localhost:4000/writing/2016/05/07/slow-motion-disaster.html">coastal erosion</a>
        in Louisiana, Vietnam War <a href="http://localhost:4000/audio/2016/01/23/d3-story-of-storrs.html">protests</a> at UConn, and brownfield <a href="http://localhost:4000/writing/2015/07/28/d3-vacant-no-more.html">restoration</a> in Connecticut.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had the pleasure of working with numerous organizations, including
        Fathom Information Design, FiveThirtyEight, WNPR, TrendCT, WHUS,
        The Lens, and more. I'll be graduating from college in May, 2018 and looking for work.
