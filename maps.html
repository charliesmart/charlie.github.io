    <h1>Maps Are Lying To You</h1>

    <p>
      Chances are, you see maps everywhere. And I'm not just talking about the kind
      you look at on your phone to help get you from point A to point B. I'm talking about
      the kind of maps that are used to convey data.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of those maps–the kind you might see in magazines or on the evening news–are
      probably choropleths. That's the kind of map where regions are colored based on some data.
    </p>

    <section class="definition">
      <p>
        <strong>choropleth</strong> <span class="pronunciation">&nbsp;/ˈkɔːrəˌplɛθ/&nbsp; </span> noun
      </p>
      <p>
        A map which uses differences in shading, colouring, or the placing of symbols within predefined areas to indicate the average values of a particular quantity in those areas.
      </p>
    </section>

    <p>
      If you're from the United States, the choropleth you're most familiar with is probably the
      ones that pop up every four years around the presidential election. Something like this.
    </p>

    <div id="viz">
      <div id="map">
        <svg id="map-svg">
        </svg>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      This map is pretty simple. If the Democratic candidate wins a state, it gets colored blue. If
        the Republican candidate wins, it gets colored red.
    </p>
