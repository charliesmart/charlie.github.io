This interactive square tile map of the United States was created using D3.js. I designed the layout of the map in Adobe Illustrator, then saved the map as an SVG and used the SVG coordinates to draw the map. In this example, the map is linked dynamically to a line graph showing the per-capita crime rate for various states over time, but the map on its own can be easily generated using the D3 plugin I created.
