In 1993, Lee Langston wrote a letter to UConn's president, encouraging him to build a cogeneration power plant on campus. For nearly a decade the engineering professor's suggestion was ignored, but now his super-efficient plant is a reality. I produced this short video about the history of the plant for WHUS Radio.
