Connecticut, like much of New England, is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, with more people dying from heroin and fentanyl overdoses than at any point in recent history. For TrendCT, I visualized every drug overdose death in the state since 2012.

This visualization was created entirely by me using D3.js.
